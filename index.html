                <p style="text-indent:50px;">I’m a university student aspiring to work as a software developer. My fields of interest are mainly the tech world, programming, health sciences and music.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:50px;">As a future engineer, I am good at tackling challenges and coming up with solutions quickly and efficiently. This is a skill I am continuing to develop by participating in various activities at school such as a Robo-Electronics club in which I built a robot, programmed in C, capable of balancing itself on a see-saw. My team managed to win first place. I’ve also participated in a hackathon organized by the school, named CodeJam, in which my team and I attempted to write Machine Learning algorithms in a bioinformatics context. This challenge was especially motivating for me as it united two of my interests: health and computer sciences. </p>
                <p style="text-indent:50px;">I am also a quick learner who greatly values self-learning. This very website, for example, is proof of this statement as I had no knowledge of either GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript or JQuery beforehand. With the help of Google, Code Academy and Stackoverflow, I’ve managed to familiarize myself enough with these tools to create this website.</p>

              <div id="experience">
                <p style="text-indent:50px;">In 2013, I became a member of Saint-John Ambulance, a volunteering organization whose mission is to provide first aid for various events ranging from local hockey tournaments to Bell Center shows. I first became a general first aider in the summer of 2014, then transitioned to being a first responder and even taking a leadership role as assistant training coordinator. As a first responder, I am required to come up with solutions and answers very quickly and take important decisions concerning the patient’s health. It has also accustomed me to working in a team, as all my roles in this organization require teamwork.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">A year ago (2014-2015), I was a mathematics tutor for Cégep-level students at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. I was required to transmit my knowledge to other students and find efficient ways to help them understand the answer to questions they had while adapting to their learning styles.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I’ve also worked as a day camp counsellor for three summers (2012-2014). Much like my volunteering, this was a leadership position requiring a lot of teamwork as I had to organize activities for young children (of ages 5-12) and animate them. Each summer, our goal was to make the vacation memorable for the campers. I learned to ‘read’ the types of personalities different campers had in order to both make compromises with them to ensure that they were participating and enjoying themselves, as well as address the troublemakers who, in most cases, rectified their behaviour after very few interventions.</p>

              <div id="other">
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Being from Montréal and having attended only French schools until university, I am also fluent at writing/talking in French. I am also fluent in Romanian as it is my mother tongue. </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> As the link to my Soundcloud suggests, I am also passionate about music. I play guitar and sing, and am working on an album. For the moment, only two of the songs that will be on it are available on my Soundcloud.</p>
